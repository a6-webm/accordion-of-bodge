add midi crate to output midi notes into a virtual midi device
 - redo midi representation?

is rawinput going to send key repeat messages?

include functionality to map any number of CSV file maps to any number of plugged in keyboards

no GUI

notification area icon?

intercept messages for any other process other than ours with a msg hook
this needs to be toggleable by key press, probably implement that into the msg_proc
