add midi crate to output midi notes into a virtual midi device
 - redo midi representation?

is rawinput going to send key repeat messages?

include functionality to map any number of CSV file maps to any number of plugged in keyboards

no GUI

notification area icon?

shamelessly learn the correct implementation of what ur trying to do from LuaMacros,
  - Shared memory instead of global vars
  - Some KeyLog structure that records past rawinput inputs
    - do we want to detect altgr? (eh)
  - A keyboard hook that polls the KeyLog if the input matches something previous or if it should wait until the rawinput comes through
    - it uses this poll to decide whether to capture the input

very real chance that I need to go back and free lots of data from all my windows function calls (look at example code to figure this out)
