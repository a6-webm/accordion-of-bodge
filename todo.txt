add midi crate to output midi notes into a virtual midi device
 - redo midi representation?

how are we going to capture inputs?
 - tab into window that does nothing with inputs?
 - some way to properly capture inputs and have this toggle with a key press?
   - or maybe not toggle at all cause u've plugged in multiple keyboards
 - something about focus window?
 - something about BlockInput?
 - is rawinput going to send key repeat messages?

include functionality to map any number of CSV file maps to any number of plugged in keyboards

GUI?

notification area icon?
