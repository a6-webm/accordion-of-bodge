add midi crate to output midi notes into a virtual midi device
 - redo midi representation?

is rawinput going to send key repeat messages?

include functionality to map any number of CSV file maps to any number of plugged in keyboards

no GUI

notification area icon?

shamelessly learn the correct implementation of what ur trying to do from LuaMacros,
    - Shared memory instead of global vars
    - A keyboard hook?
    - Some way to pass a msg to the keyboard hook telling it whether it should kill an input or not ig
