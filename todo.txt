add midi crate to output midi notes into a virtual midi device
 - redo midi representation?

is rawinput going to send key repeat messages?

include functionality to map any number of CSV file maps to any number of plugged in keyboards

no GUI

notification area icon?

shamelessly learn the correct implementation of what ur trying to do from LuaMacros,
    - Shared memory instead of global vars
    - Some KeyLog structure that records past rawinput inputs
    - A keyboard hook that polls the KeyLog if the input matches something previous or if it should wait until the rawinput comes through
      - it uses this poll to decide whether to capture the input
