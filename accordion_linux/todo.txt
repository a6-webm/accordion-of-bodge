Plan:
evdev is gonna grab devices so no events get sent anywhere else
need to implement toggle to grab and ungrab devices

no aliases.csv

keymap.csv is gonna be String,Chord,Vel
    we gonna parse the string with Key::from_str(\)

event reading gonna have to be {
    read key event
        if value = 0, key was released
        if value = 1, key was pressed
}


what code:
make [(dev_path,kmap_path)]
make [MappedDev]

toggle on:
    loop{
        for each device:
            devices.fetch_events()
            if toggle, toggle off
            else play(kmap[event])
    }
toggle off:
    loop{
        for each device:
            devices.fetch_events()
            if it's a toggle, toggle on
    }
